## Adopt a Hydrant
[hydrants.codefordc.org](http://hydrants.codefordc.org)

The Adopta app is a web-based application that was originally built by [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/) fellows for Boston. Its first use case was for [adopting fire hydrants](http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=adopt-a-hydrant). It then expanded to Chicago (adopt-a-sidewalk), Honolulu ([adopt-a-siren](http://sirens.honolulu.gov/)), and is being deployed in [other cities](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=211836600249959492431.0004cd3a8a295c254cbdd&msa=0&ll=36.244273,-94.570312&spn=63.262258,101.162109). At a high level, it's an inventory system for city assets that allows citizens to "adopt" the asset. It could be a park bench, tree, sewer drain, sidewalk, hydrant, bus shelter, or other city-owned asset.

## Open 211/Community Resource Platform
DC lacks an easy way to aggregate and share essential data about the many social services. There are a number of service directory applications, but these directories are isolated from each other â€” and the resulting system is fragmented, redundant, chronically out of date, and not standardized (see dc gov's 211, bread for the city, dc food finder, bridge, etc). Our goal is to get all the data out of these systems, standardize this data, and make it available via an API so that other applications can be built on top of it.

## Education Data
We will try to identify data sets that could be used to build a product for students/parents in the District. For example, if we can get good data on the lottery system, we might be able to build a product both to help parents make better decisions about school choice, but also potentially to help the district run a more efficient and equitable lottery system.

## Problem ID Working Group
This group will work on coming up with ways to identify community problems. Will make a public list of existing problems that need to be tackled. Will talk to community organizations and leaders to get input on possible projects. Will setup a digg style/google moderator wall to all citizens to suggest projects.

Code for America's [Textizen](http://www.textizen.com/welcome) app could be useful for this project.

## ANC
Given that ANC is the most local form of 'official' government in DC, the group is trying to get a sense of who the ANC commissioners are, and how they communicate.
